# Concatination check

# Task One
first_name = 'Joshua'
favorite_game = 'High on Life'
print('Hello my name is '+first_name+' and I love playing the game '+favorite_game+'.')


# Task Two
print('What I\'ve learned about concatination:')
print('First is that, it takes up a ton of processing for larger concatinated strings which can lead to lag and even a delay on loading if you use concatination too much. Which is why you are going to mostly use F-Strings.')
print('Secondly, Concatination looks bad in comparison to an F-String. I used concatination last year in our mini lessons on JavaScript but never got to use F-Strings. I like F-Strings better.')


# Task Three
chicken_fries5pc = 4.79

print('The price of the hip BK item "Chicken fries" is $'+str(chicken_fries5pc)+'.')
